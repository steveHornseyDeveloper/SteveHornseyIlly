This is a project which can compare any two of the same flat objects. It uses a basic command line program to define properties of a person, but I'd recommend using the configured unit tests or Object initialiser in the Program.CS file to see how it works.

A future improvement would be the handling of complex objects. Another would be a good user interface with object type selector or tying it into another process to pass it objects.
